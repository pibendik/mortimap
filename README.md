# mortimap

I always wanted to program my own thing, and maybe just totally revolutionize the world a bit.

Morten said, just do it, so I'm making my map dream a reality. Thanks, Morticii!

## Maps

Sometimes, experts want to make lots of people answer map based questions. This is their way to do so. Text inputs, and map displays in one. Can be useful. Just upload whatever map layers and base maps you want your users to see, and write their assignments so precisely and detailed, that anyone can manage to do a good job. That's the goal of Mortimap

## dev setup:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

optionally, you can attatch to the backend container and run the ./testing.sh script to start seeing the automated tests.
